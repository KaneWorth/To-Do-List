# To-Do-List

A simple to do list, single page application.

Add/Remove items at will and check off items in the list as you progress.

This spa will allow you to check off an item once you have completed it, and display with a green tick.

You can also remove any particular item within the list by pressing the relevant red cross button next to the item.

The only thing missing on this spa is the ability to store and save data, meaning if you refresh the page it will reset the entire app.

I can add this functionality at a later day and it will be on my commit to do list eventually in the future.
